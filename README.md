# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning  â€” Projects

Author: Lucas de Boer

## ðŸ“‚ Overview

This repository contains some of my work and experiments practicing machine learning with Python. It includes Jupyter Notebooks exploring data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, regression models, and classification techniques.

The projects here are based on datasets provided during coursework and Kaggle, and serve as practice in applying machine learning concepts to real-world data.
